            <section class="intro">
                <article class="h-entry" >
                 
                    
                     
                       
                    <p> 
                        The main design principle for the website is simplicity for the websiteâ€™s UI to be intuitive and easy to navigate. Reducing clutter on websites helps people who use screen readers to navigate the website with more ease and accessibility and inclusion is something I try to embed in my designs. I want to ensure the information and text of the website are the most important therefor I did not add distracting images or background animations etc.  My goal for the blogs is the same, to not have them feel cluttered with distracting background images but rather make the text central. I will also try and use minimal images and videos to try and reduce the amount of data the website will require from users when browsing. 
                        </p>
                        <p> Consistency is also an important aspect to uphold for this project. Having the navigation system and buttons stay the same colours, fonts and shapes is important otherwise it can cause confusion for the user and disrupt the theme and coherence of the website. </p>
                        <p>
                        I wanted a calming feel to the website and have the website reflect a little about me. Therefor, I chose my favourite colours pink and blue as the theme for the website. I chose them in pale hues to ensure it was not bright and distracting but rather calm and easy on the eyes. The pink and the blue with the chosen sans-serif font, Yusei Magic, give the website a playful feel as well. Yusei magic is sans-serif which makes it slightly more user friendly to dyslexic users.  To add a bit of life to the website without causing distraction I have added animations to the links and buttons. They work as playful surprises when the user hovers above links and buttons. 
                        </p>
                        <p>In an effort to try and ensure that everyone who visits the website does not have a bad experiance I will add trigger warnings to any content that deals with sensitive subjects so that no one reads a blog that could be potentially triggering to them.</p>
                        <p> As the website progresses, I will add small geometric patterns as a nod to my creative projective which is geometric Islamic art. The homepage image will also consist of art relevant to my main creative project.</p>
                        <p> The goal for the technical aspect of the website is to have the website be as responsive as possible. Having a responsive Nav bar and content is important because it allows for a larger audience of people to access and consume the websites content. If it is limited to laptop users only and cannot accommodate for mobile users, the website will be at a severe disadvantage as most people carry their phones around with them everywhere and will likely read the blogs on the website on their phone. Therefore, the biggest concern is to ensure the blogs are readable on as many screens as possible. My next greatest concern is having the navigation be responsive as without an intuitive and easy to use navigation system the user will get frustrated and leave the website. With creating a responsive website as my main goal, all the elements on the website are responsive and the website will smoothly operate on multiple devices. I am still currently working on making the images more responsive as they do not scale accurately enough from device to device. </p> 
                        <p>Additionally it is important to still adhere to conventions like having metatags and alternate titles for pictures to ensure screen readers can describe the image. I used the <i>Web accessibility in Mind</i> guide to title my alternative tags approprietly. Read the guide here <a class="here" href="//webaim.org/techniques/alttext/">here </a></p>
                        <p>Currently the website does not use any ARIA tags. Therefor, the goal for the future of the website on a technical level will include integrating ARIA tags to create a more inclusive website.</p>
